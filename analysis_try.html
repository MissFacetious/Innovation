    <h1>Creative Innovation: Models and Analysis</h1>
    <h3 class="text-normal">
      Due to the number and diverse amount of data being analyzed for this effort, our method requires several different approaches. These analyses 
      can be found in our <a href="https://github.gatech.edu/lwalkosz3/Innovation/tree/master/data_analysis">Data Analysis</a> folder.

      <br><br>
      <div class="content">
        K-means clustering was used for the unsupervised model. We hypothesized that innovation is influenced by both creative 
        and non-creative (economic) factors. However, to determine which combination of factor types (creative only, non-creative 
        only, or both) was the best set of inputs for innovation, we ran separate clustering models for each of these three 
        conditions, allowing the user to compare between each set of factors. <br><br>
        The dropdown can be used to toggle between the three conditions, while the slider allows for variation in 
        the number of clusters. <br><br>

      <br><br>
      <div class="content">
        Regressions that incorporated feature selection were used for the supervised models, which was our attempt to assign 
        an innovation score for each country. Predictor variables consisted of both creative and non-creative (economic) 
        factors, while the global innovation index was used as a proxy for an innovation response variable ("original innovation index").<br><br>
        Since the integrated dataset included dozens of columns, feature selection was a key component in our models. 
        We explored a variety of models but ultimately decided to visualize the results from the:
          <ul>
            <li>recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) linear regression model ("rfe prediction")</li>
            <li>lasso linear regression model ("lasso prediction")</li>
          </ul>
        The dropdown can be used to toggle between the different innovation scores that were both modeled by the regression models and provided
        by the global innovation index.<br><br>
