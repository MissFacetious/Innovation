        <div class="content">
          <br>Since innovation is an <span class="text-bold text-green">intangible concept</span>, there currently isn't a true indicator or metric
          for innovation. As such, we will use an unsupervised model where nations with similar levels of innovation
          will be <span class="text-bold text-green">clustered</span> together.<br><br>Additionally, we will be able to use the <span class="text-bold text-green">Global Innovation Index</span>
          as a benchmark for our supervised learning approach, and compare the results of our two models.

        <div class="content">
          <br>We intended to analyze a variety of measures (including <span class="text-bold text-blue">creative and economic factors</span>)
          to determine which of these are potentially significant predictors of what makes a nation innovative.

      <div class="content">
        <br>We obtained and integrated <span class="text-bold text-yellow">40 datasets from various sources</span> such as the World Bank,
        the Global Innovation Index site, and UNESCO. Some <a href="https://github.gatech.edu/lwalkosz3/Innovation/tree/master/data">datasets</a>
        that we looked at include:
          <ul>
            <li>books published per country per year</li>
            <li>scientific publications</li>
            <li>GDP</li>
          </ul>
        Our datasets also contained time series <span class="text-bold text-yellow">data ranging from 1950 to 2020</span> for a
        <span class="text-bold text-yellow">variety of countries</span>.
        <br><br>Many countries also had <span class="text-bold text-yellow">sparse data</span>, which presented an additional challenge
        during the pre-processing phases. After normalizing and creating an <a href="https://github.gatech.edu/lwalkosz3/Innovation/tree/master/data_integration">integrated dataset</a>,
        we proceeded with our analysis.
